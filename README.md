# The Paradox of the Economy

Society is kind of impossible.

**Hypothesis**: there is never enough money in society for everyone to pay for what they need. Costs are recursively defined and inflationary, everyone is a cost to everyone else. Very few people earn more than they cost.

Everyone in a society needs food, shelter and money to buy these things.

Each person needs to earn enough to pay for food, shelter and bills such as energy.

Every product that that person buys must also fund the same for all the workers and owners of the manufacturers of that product or service.

The relationship is recursive. How can there not be poor people? Everyone has to provide for everyone else in addition to themselves. The cost of bread needs to pay for the wages and wheat costs and shelter costs of all the staff at the bread company.

Surely this is an absurdity. Even if people earn different amounts and products cost different prices and producers can sell to any number of people - one person can at most support themselves and a fraction or number of additional people with their purchases of the above needs.

Buying a tin of food or service must pay for all the things that all the people who produce the product or service need.

If the employees of the company that produces food also need to buy products that they produce, they do not get it for free.

There is more poor people than wealthy people. This is evidence of the theory.

The only thing that is a limitless resource is work itself.

Most people have 40 hours a week to earn enough to pay for everything.

My only explanation is that the number of products is not limited by anything but money and work so a company can sell any number of products.

Money is therefore created from work

But money is not created from work it is simply reassigned.

So money is printed into existence by debt.

If you want to buy a product or service, you must work in excess of that products value.

So everyone is working for money, their work is valued at an amount. The work must afford supplying themselves and everyone else of products and services that they each need.

Obviously there isn't enough work done to produce money so people remain poor. The value of people's work is low.

This is therefore the paradox of the economy. There is guaranteed to be poor people and everyone is on a treadmill of work to pay for themselves and the costs of everyone else.
