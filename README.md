Society is kind of impossible

Everyone in a society needs food, shelter and money to buy these things.

Each person needs to earn enough to pay for food, shelter and bills such as energy

Every product that that person buys must also fund the same for all the workers and owners of the manufacturers of that product.

Surely this is an absurdity. Even if people earn different amounts and products cost different prices - one person can at most support themselves and a fraction or number of additional people with their purchases of the above needs.

Buying a tin of food or service must pay for all the things that all the people who produce the product or service need.

If the employees of the company that produces food also need to buy products that they produce, they do not get it for free.

There is more poor people than wealthy people.

The only thing that is a limitless resource is work itself.

Most people have 40 hours a week to earn enough to pay for everything.

My only explanation is that the number of products is not limited by anything but money and work so a company can sell any number of products.

Money is therefore created from work

But money is not created from work it is simply reassigned.

So money is printed into existence by debt.

If you want to buy a product or service, you must work in excess of that products value.

So everyone is working for money, their work is valued at an amount. The work must afford supplying themselves and everyone else of products and services that they each need.
